Rapid Scheme
============

A Scheme implementation in the browser

Overview
--------

Rapid Scheme will be an R7RS compliant Scheme implementation including a compiler that compiles a Scheme program to a web worker that can be run in a browser environment. The compiler itself is written in Scheme and will be able to compile itself. A set of Javascript tools to run the generated web worker will be provided.

Quick Start
-----------

At the moment, the implementation is work-in-progress.
