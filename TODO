* Implement syntax-error (use syntax-error syntax itself for location of compile error)

* Implement %define-syntax and syntax-rules

* syntax-rules is special syntax in (scheme base). It is not being checked in %define-syntax.

* Handle reader errors in read-file (and read-library-...?)

* Check whether imported identifiers are being overwritten

* Correct various uses of test-equal (the expected value has to come first)

* Rename record types into the <...> format

* Refactor syntax objects to (rapid compiler syntax). Check test for read.

* Rename (rapid table) to (rapid tables), and (rapid box) to (rapid boxes)

* See whether #|... (eof) makes any problems in reader (should raise an error)
