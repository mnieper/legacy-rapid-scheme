- Continue to implement (begin ...) in libraries.
- Write tests of all implemented features.
- What is a "named" exactly? (Would call it as an expression; either (type of) syntax or location.) Define it as a procedure or a record type. 
- Check whether it is possible for an identifier to be defined and later modified by an import set. And check whether rapid allows this.
