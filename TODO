* Implement define-syntax and syntax-rules

* Check whether imported identifiers are being overwritten

* Correct various uses of test-equal (the expected value has to come first)

* Rename record types into the <...> format

* Refactor syntax objects to (rapid compiler syntax). Check test for read.

* Rename (rapid table) to (rapid tables), and (rapid box) to (rapid boxes)

* See whether #|... (eof) makes any problems in reader (should raise an error)
