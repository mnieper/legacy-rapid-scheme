- Better error reporting (e.g. by attaching information to the generated symbols or by storing this information in assoc lists that are maintained throughout the stages). This information is a linked list giving the position inside the source code.
- Continue to implement (begin ...) in libraries.
- Write tests of all implemented features.
- At the moment, everything that is a symbol? is regarded as an identifier (including _). We may change this.

- Input, output and error window constructors in rapid.js
- perf in running window

- Next step: rewrite exit and exit handling
