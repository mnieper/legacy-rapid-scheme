- Implement a garbage collector (note: check whether a, e, p registers may hold pointers)
- Minimize heap usage by putting current frame in registers
- Check whether calling is better than a large switch statement
- Better error reporting (e.g. by attaching information to the generated symbols or by storing this information in assoc lists that are maintained throughout the stages). This information is a linked list giving the position inside the source code.
- Continue to implement (begin ...) in libraries.
- Write tests of all implemented features.
- At the moment, everything that is a symbol? is regarded as an identifier (including _). We may change this.


Assembler
---------

- Recognize constants (i.e. global identifiers just set! once or local identifiers never set!) and emit special code.
- Offer an optimized mode that skips all non-obligatory runtime error checks.

asm.js
------

- Tell the asm.js backend about operator precedence
